## Objective
This project analyzes sales data from Instacart to derive insights into customer purchasing behaviors and sales patterns. The analysis aims to inform targeted marketing strategies, helping Instacart enhance segmentation and improve advertising efficacy.

## Key Questions
- **What's the distribution amoung users in regards to their brand loyalty?** 
- **Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?** 
- **Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?** 
- **Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?** 
This includes:
  - Brand loyalty.
  - Ordering habits based on loyalty status.
  - Regional differences in ordering habits.
  - Connections between demographic factors (age, family status) and ordering patterns.
  - Influence of demographic information (age, income, types of goods, family status) on purchasing behavior.
  - Differences in the ordering habits of various customer profiles.

These questions are designed to dissect the complex consumer behavior within Instacart's shopping environment, providing targeted insights for strategic marketing planning.

## Data
This project uses several open-source data sets from Instacart alongside a specially created customer data set. The data includes customers, orders, products, and departments.

### Data Sets:
- **Customers**: Analyzed for purchasing patterns and loyalty.
- **Orders**: Studied to determine busy times and spending habits.
- **Products**: Categorized to understand popularity and sales impact.
- **Departments**: Analyzed for sales volume per department.

## Tools
This analysis is conducted using Python with the following libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualization

## Executing the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Navigate to the `03 Scripts` folder and run the Jupyter notebooks through Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Resources and Folders Structure
- **01 Project Management**: Contains the project brief.
- **02 Data**: Divided into 'Original Data' and 'Prepared Data'. (Note: Due to file size limitations, the data files are not uploaded to GitHub.)
- **03 Scripts**: Contains the Jupyter notebooks with the project code.
- **04 Analysis**: Includes visualizations in the 'Visualizations' subfolder.
- **05 Sent to Client**: Contains the final report formatted in Excel.

## Note
Instacart is a real company with publicly available data. However, the specific project context and objectives mentioned here have been created solely for the purpose of this analysis.
